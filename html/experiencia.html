                I started as a B2C Customer Service Representative, dedicated to delivering exceptional customer service by assisting users with warranty claims, missing parts, technical inquiries, and returns processing.
In my second year with the company, around June 2021, I was promoted to the B2B department. Here, I support retail customers by addressing their concerns, providing product information, coordinating transport services, processing defective tool returns, and managing sales and warranty orders. 
Currently, I specialize in processing returns for retailers as part of a specialized returns team. 
Our team ensures excellent service for each retailer, handling returned items promptly and efficiently, regardless of whether they're defective. We also provide return labels and handle replacements for damaged or faulty products in large orders.

Additionally, assumed the role of Bilingual Supervisor on my second year within the company, overseeing agents' call handling, supervisory tasks such as intervening in escalated calls when passengers requested a supervisor, personnel management, monitoring quality indicators, and diligently tracking daily and monthly metrics to ensure performance goals were met.
