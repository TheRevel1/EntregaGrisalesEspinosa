            <p>
                I started as a B2C Customer Service Representative, dedicated to delivering exceptional customer service
                by assisting users with warranty claims, missing parts, technical inquiries, and returns processing.
                In my second year with the company, around June 2021, I was promoted to the B2B department. Here, I
                support retail customers by addressing their concerns, providing product information, coordinating
                transport services, processing defective tool returns, and managing sales and warranty orders.
                Currently, I specialize in processing returns for retailers as part of a specialized returns team.
                Our team ensures excellent service for each retailer, handling returned items promptly and efficiently,
                regardless of whether they're defective. We also provide return labels and handle replacements for
                damaged or faulty products in large orders.

                Addressing technical issues, clarifying doubts, and resolving billing concerns related to internet and

            <p>
                Provided telephone assistance to international passengers of LATAM AIRLINES in English, handling various
                inquiries including reservations, sales of special services for specific passenger needs, ticket
                reissues, rescheduling, complaints, claims, email correspondence for general cases, refunds,
                compensations, and more. Managed calls from diverse regions such as Australia, New Zealand, India,
                England, United States, European countries, and foreign passengers vacationing in South America.
                Additionally, assumed the role of Bilingual Supervisor on my second year within the company, overseeing
                agents' call handling, supervisory tasks such as intervening in escalated calls when passengers
                requested a supervisor, personnel management, monitoring quality indicators, and diligently tracking
                daily and monthly metrics to ensure performance goals were met. These metrics included but were not
                limited to call resolution times, customer satisfaction scores, first-call resolution rates, and
                adherence to company protocols, among other supervisory responsibilities.
